= Introduction to hledger-grammars

TODO: write http://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/[great documentation]


== Why?

I felt the need to build some grammars for hledger since I wanted to process the formats from other languages.
More specifically I wanted to build some tooling in ClojureScript.

By producing (Antlr) grammars people can parse, validate and convert hledger journal files using a multitude of languages.
Some of them are Clojure, Java and all JVM languages, ClojureScript, JavaScript and all the Nodejs/Browser languages, python, C,C++, etc.
Here is the full list of https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/4.6/doc/targets.md[Antlr 4 target languages and runtimes].
