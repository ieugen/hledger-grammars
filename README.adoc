= hledger-grammars

A set of https://www.antlr.org/[Antlr] grammars for parsing hledger journal formats.
To my knowledge the formats are designed with a manual parser in mind.
The aim of this project is to implement a sub-set good enough so that people can use the tool with journal files that are manually maintained and/or generated by tools.
